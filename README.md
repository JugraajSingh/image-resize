## Image Resizer

This handy web app helps you quickly resize images for popular social media platforms and websites.

### Features

* **Effortless Uploads:** Upload your desired image using the intuitive file selection option.
* **Predefined Dimensions:** Choose from convenient resize buttons for Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or Websites. Each button resizes the image to the appropriate dimensions for that platform.
* **Visual Preview:** See the resized image instantly, allowing you to confirm it meets your needs before saving.

**Note:** Currently, this application only resizes the image displayed on the screen. It doesn't modify the original uploaded file.

### Using the Image Resizer

1. Click "Choose File" and select the image you want to resize.
2. Choose the platform or website you intend to use the image on (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Website). Each button will resize the image accordingly.
3. The resized image will be displayed on the screen, allowing you to preview it.

**Please note:** This is a basic image resizer and doesn't currently offer functionalities like downloading the resized image.
